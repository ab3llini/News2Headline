## Abstract
Automatic headline generation is a sub-task of document summarization with many reported applications.
The aim of this paper is to describe the approach that we followed to predict articles headline starting from their content. We first introduce the reasons and related work that inspired us, illustrate the dataset we used, present some of the foundamental preprocessing steps performed on the dataset and then we dive into the details about the model we used. We are proposing two different models, both made up by an Encoder-Decoder neural network architecture that exploits pre-trained GloVe embeddings. In the last section we present results of our models against the state-of-the-art techniques using three different evaluation metrics: BLEU, Semantic Similarity and Syntactic Correctness.
This work has been developed as a class project for UIC CS 521: Statistical Natural Language Processing.
